## Reflection Questions

-What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course? 
The goal was to create a program that could load course data from a file, organize it, sort it alphanumerically, and allow users to search for specific course information easily.

-How did you approach the problem? 
At first, I thought a binary search tree (BST) would be the easiest structure because it keeps everything sorted automatically. After working through the project, I realized that linked lists are actually much easier to build and manage for simple tasks. Binary trees are definitely more powerful for sorting and searching fast, but they took a lot more planning and careful building.

-How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project? 
I ran into problems with loading the file properly and figuring out where to put the CSV file so the program could find it. I overcame that by learning how Visual Studio organizes project folders, and by adjusting how the program asks for and loads the file. I also had to fix a few mistakes with how the file input and whitespace were handled.

-How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project taught me that picking the right data structure is really important for the type of problem you're solving. It’s not just about getting something to work, it’s about making it work smarter and faster. I also learned that user experience, like clear prompts and error messages, makes a big difference in the quality of a program.

-How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable? 
I started focusing a lot more on making my code easy to read and organize. I used clear variable names, wrote comments explaining the tricky parts, and think on about a outward perspective, about how someone else might use or modify my code in the future.
